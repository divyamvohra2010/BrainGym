# Brain Gym - AI-Powered Brain Development Exercises for Children

## Overview
Brain Gym is an interactive web application designed to help children develop cognitive skills through fun, movement-based exercises. Using AI-powered computer vision (OpenAI GPT-5 Vision), the app provides real-time feedback on exercise performance, awards points for correct form, and gamifies the learning experience with a competitive leaderboard.

## Current State
**Status**: MVP Complete
**Last Updated**: October 25, 2025

The application is fully functional with all core features implemented:
- 6 different brain gym exercises with detailed instructions
- Real-time webcam-based exercise validation using OpenAI Vision
- Points system with instant feedback
- Global leaderboard tracking top performers
- Child-friendly, colorful UI with smooth animations

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
